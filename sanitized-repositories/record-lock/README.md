# RECORD LOCK — Sanitized Public Reference

[![Quality checks](https://github.com/hr185882-creator/clia-portfolio/actions/workflows/quality.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hr185882-creator/clia-portfolio/actions/workflows/quality.yml)

A public-safe reference architecture for converting source collections into auditable analytical records with explicit provenance, claim states, competing hypotheses, confidence labels, falsifiers, and revision conditions.

## Why this sanitized repository exists

The production deployment contains packaged research materials and internal publication controls that are not appropriate for unrestricted redistribution. This kit exposes the system design and fictional schemas without publishing licensed documents, private research notes, credentials, sensitive personal data, or production-only moderation controls.

This is a reference implementation and documentation package, not a byte-for-byte copy of the production deployment.

## Core design objective

A RECORD LOCK entry should allow another reviewer to answer:

1. What exactly is being claimed?
2. Which sources directly support it?
3. Are those sources independent?
4. What evidence contradicts or limits it?
5. What is fact, inference, forecast, speculation, or unverified reporting?
6. What confidence level is justified?
7. What would falsify or revise the judgment?
8. Who approved the record, and when?

## Repository map

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — analytical pipeline and release controls
- `docs/CLAIM_SCHEMA.md` — field definitions and validation requirements
- `data/example-record-lock.json` — fictional public-safe example records
- `.github/workflows/quality.yml` — ready-to-copy deterministic validation

## Analytical labels

- `fact` — directly supported by a qualifying source
- `inference` — reasoned conclusion derived from stated facts and assumptions
- `forecast` — probabilistic judgment about a future outcome
- `speculation` — possibility not sufficiently supported for analytical reliance
- `unverified_claim` — attributed assertion not independently established

## Confidence levels

- `directional` — useful signal with substantial uncertainty
- `high_confidence` — strong evidence and limited plausible alternatives
- `verified` — outcome or proposition established by the controlling record

Confidence labels describe evidentiary support, not rhetorical certainty. A record must include its strongest counterargument and clearest revision condition.

## Authorship and AI assistance

Hasan Raza Kazmi directs the research questions, evidence standards, analytical framework, product architecture, editorial judgment, QA, and publication decisions. AI systems may assist with coding, synthesis, formatting, or production, but do not replace source verification or final human judgment.

## Security boundary

Never commit credentials, restricted documents, personal identifiers, internal-only notes, sealed material, or unlawful content. Public examples must be fictional or based on records whose publication and representation have been independently reviewed.

## License boundary

The original reference documentation, fictional schemas, and example records may be reused with attribution. Underlying third-party documents and source materials retain their original rights and restrictions and are not redistributed through this kit.
